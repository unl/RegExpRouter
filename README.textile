h1. RegExpRouter

h2. Introduction

RegExpRouter is a php router system that routes clean URLs based on regular expressions.

For each Model that has a route, you will need to place a file named "Routes" within that class, which implements RegExpRouter_RoutesInterface and define the regex routes for the model.

h3. *The router will scan though your models and load routes.  To do so you need to make sure your files are set up like this:*

@ /Example
    /Example
       /Routes.php (class name for Routes.php would be Example_Routes because its sits in he 'Example' directory.)@

$options = array('baseURL'=>'yoururl', 'classDir'=>'yourClassDir', 'classPrefix'=>'yourClassPrefix');
$router = new RegExpRouter($options);
$router->route($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_GET);


h3. *Or you can compile the array of regex to model mapping yourself and call the RegExpRouter->setRoutes(array) method:*

$options = array('baseURL'=>'yoururl');
$router = new RegExpRouter($options);
$router->setRoutes(array('/^home$/i' => 'Example_Home_View'));
$router->route($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_GET);


h2. Example

To view the very simple Example application in the Example folder to get a better feel of how it works.

To set up the example application you will have to do the following:
1) Copy the config.sample.php to a new file called config.inc.php in the same folder.
2) Change the Example_Controller::$url in config.inc.php to a url that works with your setup.
3) Copy the sample.htaccess file to a new file called .htaccess in the same folder.
4) In .htaccess change the RewriteBase path to work with your setup.
